1. Intro                                                       *NERD_comments*

NERD_comments provides a set of handy key mappings for commenting code. These
mappings are consistent across all supported filetypes.

When writing NERD_comments I have tried to give it as many features/options as
possible while keeping it so that the plugin can still be used with little or
no knowledge of these. The average user need only know about a few key
mappings to use NERD_comments while there are plenty of other features for the
l33t nerd take advantage of.

Enjoy :D

==============================================================================
2. Functionality provided                             *NERD_com-Functionality*

The following key mappings are provided by default (there is also a menu
provided that contains menu items corresponding to all the below mappings):

Note: <leader> is a user defined key that is used to start keymappings and
defaults to \. Check out |<leader>| for details.

<leader>cc      Comments out the current line. If multiple lines are selected
in visual mode, they are all commented out.
If some text is selected in visual or visual-block mode then NERD_comments
will comment out the exact text that is selected. It will use multi-part
delimiters if they are available (and if the
NERD_allow_any_visual_delims_regexp matches the current filetype).  Works in
normal,visual and visual block modes.  The keys for this mappings can be
overridden with the |NERD_com_line_map| option.

<leader>cs  Performs sexy commenting see |NERD_com_sexy_commenting| for a
description of what it is. Can only be done on filetypes for which there is
exactly one set of multipart comment delimiters specified. Works in normal and
visual modes. The keys for this mapping can be overriden,  see
|NERD_com_line_sexy_map|

<leader>cy  Same as <leader>cc except that it yanks the line(s) that are
commented first. The keys for this mapping can be overriden,  see
|NERD_com_line_yank_map|

<leader>cl <leader>cr <leader>cb    Same as <leader>cc except that the comment
delimiters are aligned on the left side, right side or both sides
respectively. These comments are always nested if the line(s) are already
commented. NERD_comments can be told to align comment delimiters by default
when <leader>cc is pressed --- see |NERD_left_align_regexp|
|NERD_right_align_regexp|. Works in normal and visual modes These mappings can
be customised, see |NERD_com_align_left_map| |NERD_com_align_right_map|
|NERD_com_align_both_map|.

<leader>cu      Uncomments the current line. If multiple lines are selected in
visual mode then they are all uncommented. If the current filetype has
alternate comment delimiters and the line(s) contain these then the
"outtermost" delimiters will be removed. NERD_comments can be told to only
remove delimiters that are currently being used --- see
|NERD_dont_remove_alt_coms|. Works in normal,visual modes.  The keys for this
mappings can be overridden with the |NERD_uncom_line_map| option.

<leader>cn      Nested commenting. Works the same as <leader>cc except that if
a line is commented, it will be commented again. If the filetype is covered by
the NERD_place_holder_regexp regular expression then place-holder delimiters
will be used to delimit the nested comment. Otherwise the nested comment will
only be added if the current commenting style has no right delimiter (which
could cause compiler errors) Works in normal,visual modes.  The keys for this
mappings can be overridden with the |NERD_com_line_nest_map| option.

<leader>c$      Comments the current line from the current cursor position up
to the end of the line. Works in normal mode. The keys for this mappings can
be overridden with the |NERD_com_to_end_of_line_map| option.

<leader>ca      Changes to the alternative commenting style if one is
available. For example, if the user is editing a c++ file using // comments
and they hit <leader>ca then they will switched over to /**/ comments.  Works
in normal mode. The keys for this mappings can be overridden with the
|NERD_alt_com_map| option. See also |NERD_dont_remove_alt_coms|.

<leader>cA      Appends comment delimiters to the end of the current line and goes
to insert mode between the new delimiters.  Works in normal mode. The keys for
this mappings can be overridden with the |NERD_append_com_map| option.

<leader>cI      Appends comment delimiters to the start of the current line
and goes to insert mode between the new delimiters.  Works in normal mode. The
keys for this mappings can be overridden with the |NERD_prepend_com_map|
option.

<C-c>       Adds comment delimiters at the current cursor position and inserts
between them. Works in insert mode. The keys for this mappings can be
overridden with the |NERD_com_in_insert_map| option.

If a language is not in the list of hardcoded supported filetypes then the
&commentstring vim option is used.

Sexy Comments~                                      *NERD_com_sexy_commenting*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
These are comments that use one set of multipart comment delimiters as well as
one other marker symbol. For example: >
    /*
     * This is a c style sexy comment
     * So there!
     */
<
Here the multipart delimiters are /* and */ and the marker is *. NERD_comments
is capable of adding and removing comments of this type.


==============================================================================
3. Customisation                                      *NERD_com-Customisation*

To enable any of the below options you should put the given line in your
~/.vimrc

General options~
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                       *loaded_nerd_comments*
If this script is driving you insane you can turn it off by setting this
option >
    let loaded_nerd_comments=1
<
                                        *NERD_allow_any_visual_delims_regexp*
This option is set to a regular expression that is used to specify which
filetypes this option should be turned on for. See |NERD_place_holder_regexp|
and |NERD_use_sexy_coms_default_regexp|.  If this covers the current filetype
then, when NERD_comments is doing a visual or visual-block comment (but not a
visual-line comment) it will choose the right delimiters to use for the
comment. This normally means using the current delimiters if they are
multipart or using the alternative delimiters if THEY are multipart and the
current delims are not.  For example if we are editing the following java
code: >
    float foo = 1221;
    float bar = 324;
    System.out.println(foo * bar);
<
If we are using // comments and select the "foo" and "bar" in visual-block
mode, as shown left below (where '|'s are used to represent the visual-block
boundary), and comment it then it will use the alternative delims as shown on
the right: >
    float |foo| = 1221;                   float /*foo*/ = 1221;
    float |bar| = 324;                    float /*bar*/ = 324;
    System.out.println(foo * bar);        System.out.println(foo * bar);
<
By default this option is set to '.*' i.e is turned on for all filetypes.

                                            *NERD_block_com_after_right*
This option affects commenting when it is done in visual-block mode. If this
option is turned on, lines that begin outside the right boundary of the
selection block will be commented. Enable this option with: >
    let NERD_block_com_after_right=1
<
For example, if you are commenting this chunk of c code in visual-block mode
(where the '|'s are used to represent the visual-block boundary) >
    #include <sys/types.h>
    #include <unistd.h>
    #include <stdio.h>
   |int| main(){
   |   | printf("SUCK THIS\n");
   |   | while(1){
   |   |     fork();
   |   | }
   |}  |
<
If NERD_block_com_after_right=1 then this code will become: >
    #include <sys/types.h>
    #include <unistd.h>
    #include <stdio.h>
    /*int*/ main(){
    /*   */ printf("SUCK THIS\n");
    /*   */ while(1){
    /*   */     fork();
    /*   */ }
    /*}  */
<
Otherwise, the code block would become: >
    #include <sys/types.h>
    #include <unistd.h>
    #include <stdio.h>
    /*int*/ main(){
	printf("SUCK THIS\n");
	while(1){
	    fork();
	}
    /*}  */
<

                                          *NERD_comment_whole_lines_in_v_mode*
This option can take 2 values. By default NERD_comments tries to comment out
exactly what is selected in visual mode (v). For example if you select and
comment the following c code (using | to represent the visual boundary): >
    in|t foo = 3;
    int bar =| 9;
    int baz = foo + bar;
<
This will result in: >
    in/*t foo = 3;
    int bar =*/ 9;
    int baz = foo + bar;
<
But some people prefer it if the whole lines are commented like: >
    /*int foo = 3;*/
    /*int bar = 9;*/
    int baz = foo + bar;
<
If you prefer the second option then stick this line in your .vimrc: >
    let NERD_comment_whole_lines_in_v_mode=1
<

If the filetype you are editing only has no multipart delimiters (for example
a shell script) and you hadnt set this option then the above would become >
    in#t foo = 3;
    #int bar = 9;
<
(where # is the comment delimiter) as this is the closest NERD_comments can
come to commenting out exactly what was selected. If you prefer for whole
lines to be commented out when there is no multipart delimiters but the EXACT
text that was selected to be commented out if there IS multipart delimiters
then stick the following line in your .vimrc: >
    let NERD_comment_whole_lines_in_v_mode=2
<

Note that this option does not affect the behaviour of visual-block mode ().

                                                   *NERD_dont_remove_alt_coms*
When uncommenting a line when there is an alternative commenting style for the
current filetype, this option tells the script not to look for, and remove,
comments delimiters of the alternative style. >
    let NERD_dont_remove_alt_coms=1
<
For example, if you are editing a c++ file using // style comments and you go
<leader>cu on this line: >
    /* This is a c++ comment baby! */
<
It will not be uncommented if the NERD_dont_remove_alt_coms is set to 1.

                                                      *NERD_create_h_filetype*
If this option is set then NERD_comments will create a seperate filetype for h
files. This could be needed because some versions of vim treat h files as cpp
files which can be dodgy for commenting because if you are using // to comment
cpp files then this is invalid when you are commenting h files for a c
project (unless you arent adhering to the ANSI standard... naughty naughty).
To enable this option, stick the following line in your .vimrc: >
    let NERD_create_h_filetype = 1
<

                                                                 *NERD_lPlace*
								 *NERD_rPlace*
These options are used to control the strings used as place-holder delimiters.
Place holder delimiters are used when performing nested commenting when the
filetype supports commenting styles with both left and right delimiters.
To set these options use lines like: >
    let NERD_lPlace="FOO"
    let NERD_rPlace="BAR"
<
Following the above example, if we have line of c code: >
    /* int horse */
<
and we comment it with <leader>cn it will be changed to: >
    /*FOO int horse BAR*/
<
When we uncomment this line it will go back to what it was.
NERD_lPlace defaults to '[+', NERD_rPlace defaults to '+]'.

                                                      *NERD_left_align_regexp*
This option is a regular expression which is used to specify which filetypes
should have their left delimiters aligned when commenting multiple lines.

For example, consider this chunk of c code: >
    1 int foo = 3;
    2 int bar = 5;
    3 while(foo < 50){
    4	foo = foo + bar;
    5	printf("i am just making up this code\n");
    6	    printf("i have no idea what im writing\n");
    7 }
<
If the NERD_left_align_regexp regexp covers c files then if we select lines
3-7 in visual mode and hit <leader>cc the code will become: >
    1 int foo = 3;
    2 int bar = 5;
    3 /*while(foo < 50){*/
    4 /*  foo = foo + bar;*/
    5 /*  printf("i am just making up this code\n");*/
    6 /*      printf("i have no idea what im writing\n");*/
    7 /*}*/
<
If NERD_left_align_regexp doesnt cover c files then the code will become: >
    1 int foo = 3;
    2 int bar = 5;
    3 /* while(foo < 50){ */
    4	/* foo = foo + bar; */
    5   /* printf("i am just making up this code\n"); */
    6	    /* printf("i have no idea what im writing\n"); */
    7 /* } */
<
See |NERD_space_delim_filetype_regexp| and |NERD_place_holder_regexp| for
example regular expressions that NERD_left_align_regexp could be set to.
NERD_left_align_regexp defaults to '^$' meaning no filetypes have their left
delims aligned.

                                                    *NERD_place_holder_regexp*
This option is a regular expression which is used to specify which filetypes
place-holder delimiters should be used for when adding nested comments. Some
examples: >
    (1) let NERD_place_holder_regexp='.*'
    (3) let NERD_place_holder_regexp='^$'
    (2) let NERD_place_holder_regexp='^c.$'
    (4) let NERD_place_holder_regexp='^[^java]$'
<
(1) causes all filetypes to use place-holders (This is the default setting)
(2) prevents all filtypes from using place-holders
(3) causes filetypes 2 chars long beginning with c to use place-holders
(4) causes all filetypes except java to use place-holders

                                                      *NERD_right_align_regexp*
This option is a regular expression which is used to specify which filetypes
should have their right delimiters aligned when commenting multiple lines.

For example, consider this chunk of c code: >
    1 int foo = 3;
    2 int bar = 5;
    3 while(foo < 50){
    4	foo = foo + bar;
    5	printf("i am just making up this code\n");
    6	    printf("i have no idea what im writing\n");
    7 }
<
If the NERD_right_align_regexp regexp covers c files then if we select lines
3-7 in visual mode and hit <leader>cc the code will become: >
    1 int foo = 3;
    2 int bar = 5;
    3 /*while(foo < 50){                                 */
    4   /*foo = foo + bar;                               */
    5   /*printf("i am just making up this code\n");     */
    6       /*printf("i have no idea what im writing\n");*/
    7 /*}                                                */
<
If NERD_right_align_regexp doesnt cover c files then the code will become: >
    1 int foo = 3;
    2 int bar = 5;
    3 /* while(foo < 50){ */
    4	/* foo = foo + bar; */
    5   /* printf("i am just making up this code\n"); */
    6	    /* printf("i have no idea what im writing\n"); */
    7 /* } */
<
See |NERD_space_delim_filetype_regexp| and |NERD_place_holder_regexp| for
example regular expressions that NERD_right_align_regexp could be set to.
NERD_right_align_regexp defaults to '^$' meaning no filetypes have their right
delims aligned.

                                            *NERD_space_delim_filetype_regexp*
Some people prefer a space after the left delimiter and before the right
delimiter like this: >
    /* int foo=2; */
<
as opposed to this: >
    /*int foo=2;*/
<
This option is a regular expression that is used to specify which filetypes
NERD_comments should use spaces for (as in the first eg above). Some egs: >
    (1) let NERD_space_delim_filetype_regexp='.*'
    (2) let NERD_space_delim_filetype_regexp='^c.*$'
    (3) let NERD_space_delim_filetype_regexp='^\(c.*\|java\|tex\)$'
    (4) let NERD_space_delim_filetype_regexp='^$'
<
(1) will cause spaces to be used with all filetypes
(2) will cause spaces to be used with only with filetypes that start with c
(3) will cause spaces to be used with all filetypes starting with c as well as
java files and tex files
(4) will cause spaces not to be used with any filetypes
NERD_space_delim_filetype_regexp defaults to '^$'.

                                            *NERD_use_compact_sexy_com_regexp*
Some people may want their sexy comments to be like this: >
    /* Hi There!
     * This is a sexy comment
     * in c */
<
As opposed to like this: >
    /*
     * Hi There!
     * This is a sexy comment
     * in c
     */
<
The option NERD_use_compact_sexy_com_regexp is a regular expression. If the
filetype that the user is commenting matches this regular expression then when
they do sexy comments they will look like the first comment above.

                                            *NERD_use_sexy_coms_default_regexp*
This option is used to specify which filetypes use sexy commenting by default
when the <leader>cc mapping (or corresponding menu item) is used. The option
is a regular expression. This option will be turned on for any filetypes
matching this expression. Some egs: >
    (1) let NERD_use_sexy_coms_default_regexp='^\(c\|h\)$'
    (2) let NERD_use_sexy_coms_default_regexp='^\(c.*\|h\)$'
    (3) let NERD_use_sexy_coms_default_regexp='^\(java\)$'
<
(1) will cause c and h files to use sexy comments by default
(2) will cause any filetype starting with c (i.e. c, c++ c#...) and h files to
    use sexy commenting by default
(3) will cause java files to use sexy comments by default

                                            *NERD_use_nested_comments_default*
When this option is turned on comments are nested automatically. That is, if
you hit <leader>cc on a line that is already commented, or contains comments,
it will be commented again.  >
    let NERD_use_nested_comments_default=1
<


Comment style options~
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
These options are used to tell NERD_comments which delimiters to use for a
given filetype when it first loads up. To set one of these options just stick
the corresponding line in your .vimrc. For example: if i want to use /* */ to
delimit comments in java files instead of // (which is the default) then I
would stick this line in my .vimrc: >
    let NERD_use_c_style_java_comments=1
<

Note that if filetype has two commenting styles, which are both supported, you
can switch between them with <leader>ca. See |NERD_com-Functionality|. These
options only change which style is used when the script is initialsed.

                                        *NERD_use_c_style_acedb_comments*
Tells NERD_comments to use /**/ comments instead of // for acedb files.

                                        *NERD_use_c_style_ch_comments*
Tells NERD_comments to use /**/ comments instead of // for ch files.

                                        *NERD_use_c_style_clean_comments*
Tells NERD_comments to use /**/ comments instead of // for clean files.

                                        *NERD_use_c_style_clipper_comments*
Tells NERD_comments to use /**/ comments instead of // for clipper files.

                                        *NERD_use_c_style_cpp_comments*
Tells NERD_comments to use /**/ comments instead of // for c++ files.

                                        *NERD_use_c_style_cs_comments*
Tells NERD_comments to use /**/ comments instead of // for c# files.

                                        *NERD_use_c_style_dot_comments*
Tells NERD_comments to use /**/ comments instead of // for dot files.

Comment key mapping customisation options~
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
These options are used to override the default keys that are used for the
commenting mappings. Their values must be set to strings. As an example: if
you wanted to use the mapping <leader>foo to uncomment lines of code then
you would place this line in your vimrc >
    let NERD_uncom_line_map="<leader>foo"
<

Check out |NERD_com-Functionality| for details about what the following
mappings do.

				 *NERD_alt_com_map*
To override the <leader>ca mapping, set this option >
    let NERD_alt_com_map="<new mapping>"
<
				 *NERD_append_com_map*
To override the <leader>ce mapping, set this option >
    let NERD_append_com_map="<new mapping>"
<
				 *NERD_com_align_left_map*
To override the <leader>cl mapping, set this option >
    let NERD_com_align_left_map="<new mapping>"
<
				 *NERD_com_align_both_map*
To override the <leader>cb mapping, set this option >
    let NERD_com_align_both_map="<new mapping>"
<
				 *NERD_com_align_right_map*
To override the <leader>cr mapping, set this option >
    let NERD_com_align_right_map="<new mapping>"
<
				 *NERD_com_in_insert_map*
To override the <C-c> mapping, set this option >
    let NERD_com_in_insert_map="<new mapping>"
<
				 *NERD_com_line_map*
To override the <leader>cc mapping, set this option >
    let NERD_com_line_map="<new mapping>"
<
				 *NERD_com_line_nest_map*
To override the <leader>cn mapping, set this option >
    let NERD_com_line_nest_map="<new mapping>"
<
				 *NERD_com_line_sexy_map*
To override the <leader>cs mapping, set this option >
    let NERD_com_line_sexy_map="<new mapping>"
<
				 *NERD_com_to_end_of_line_map*
To override the <leader>c$ mapping, set this option >
    let NERD_com_to_end_of_line_map="<new mapping>"
<
				 *NERD_com_line_yank_map*
To override the <leader>cy mapping, set this option >
    let NERD_com_line_yank_map="<new mapping>"
<
				 *NERD_uncom_line_map*
To override the <leader>cu mapping, set this option >
    let NERD_uncom_line_map="<new mapping>"

4. Issues with the script                                    *NERD_com-issues*


Heuristics used to distinguish the real comment delimiters~
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Because we have comment mappings that place delimiters in the middle of lines,
for example <leader>c$ |NERD_com-Functionality|, removing comment delimiters
is a bit tricky. The reason being that just because comment delimiters
appear in a line doesnt mean they really are delimiters. For example, Java
uses // comments but the line >
    System.out.println("//");
<
clearly contains no real comment delimiters.

To distinguish between "real" comment delimiters and "fake" ones we use a set
of heuristics. For example, one such heuristic states that any comment
delimiter that has an odd number of non-escaped " characters both preceding
and following it on the line is not a comment because it is probably part of a
string. These heuristics, while usually pretty accurate, will not work all the
time.


Commenting .vim files~
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vim files are exceptionally evil to get commenting right for. This is because
the comment delimiter " is used for other things than delimiting comments. To
help comment vim files properly a set of heuristics have been written
especially for .vim files. Vim files are now commented correctly MOST of the
time.

The <C-c> mapping and xml/xml-style file~
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When using the <C-c> mapping with xml or xml-like syntax files, the indenting
of the current line can get screwed up... I blame vim and its whacked out
indenting with xml... :P
